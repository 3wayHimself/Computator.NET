# Installation & Setup
1. This project requires at least .NET Framework 4.0 Full, you can download it here (https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=17718).
2. Go to [latest release page](../releases/latest)
3. Now you can download either portable version (the one with .zip extension) or installer one (the one with .exe extension). I generally recommend one with installer, because it sets up tsl and tslf files extensions for Computator.NET in registry.
4. If you downloaded portable version just unzip it to location you want to store and you are ready to go.
5. If you downloaded version with installer just click on installer file, it will guide you through whole process and even download all the needed files and libraries (you dont even have to had .NET Framework because it can download and install it).
6. After installation or unzip, if you wan to run it already, just click on Computator.NET.exe (or Computator.NET shortcut on desktop if you had chosen installer) in whatever location you had chosen for it.
