# Computator.NET
Computator.NET is a special kind of numerical software that is fast and easy to use but not worse than others feature-wise.
![Quick presentation of Computator.NET features](http://fizyka.dk/Computator.NET/quick_presentation.gif "Quick presentation of Computator.NET features")

###It's features include:
* **Real**, **complex** and two variables (**3D**) functions **charts**
* **Real**, **complex** and two variables (**3D**) **calculator**
* Real functions **numerical calculations** including many different methods
* Over 107 **Elementary functions**
* Over 141 **Special functions**
* Over 21 **Matrix functions and operations**  
* **Scripting language** designed for scientists, with power to easy computations including matrices
* You can declare your own **custom functions** with scripting language
* **Mathematical notation**, including raising to power, just like it should be



# Release 2.0 beta
*This release is focused on removing all the limitations and inconsistencies that have been going throught Computator.NET history. Be careful, thought it may be unstable because of all the new features and huge changes to application architecture itself.*
* View [changelog here](https://github.com/PawelTroka/Computator.NET/releases/tag/v2.0.0-beta)
* Download [installer here](https://github.com/PawelTroka/Computator.NET/releases/download/v2.0.0-beta/Computator.NET.Installer.v2.0.0.beta.exe)
* Download [portable version (*.zip) here](https://github.com/PawelTroka/Computator.NET/releases/download/v2.0.0-beta/Computator.NET.v2.0.0-beta.zip)
* Alternatively [download installer here](http://fizyka.dk/Computator.NET.Installer%20v2.0.0%20beta.exe)
* Alternatively [download portable version (*.zip) here](http://fizyka.dk/Computator.NET v2.0.0-beta.zip)


# Installation & Setup
1. This project requires .NET Framework at least in version 4.0 Full, you can download it here (https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=17718).
2. Go to [latest release page](https://github.com/PawelTroka/Computator.NET/releases/latest)
3. Now you can download either portable version (the one with .zip extension) or installer one (the one with .exe extension). I generally recommend one with installer, because it sets up tsl and tslf files extensions for Computator.NET in registry.
4. If you downloaded portable version just unzip it to location you want to store and you are ready to go.
5. If you downloaded version with installer just click on installer file, it will guide you through whole process and even download all the needed files and libraries (you dont even have to had .NET Framework because it can download and install it).
6. After installation or unzip, if you want to run it already, just click on Computator.NET.exe (or Computator.NET shortcut on desktop if you had chosen installer) in whatever location you had chosen for it.



# Contributing

#####Programmers
* This repo supports **Fork & Pull Model**, you can do any useful changes and when you are done make a pull request. If your work will be of good quality it will be included in main branch.
* List of **things to do** is **updated constantly**, you can see it here: [TODO file](../master/Computator.NET/TODO). Choose wisely because some of those things are way harder than it looks.
* List of known bugs, often with little or no reasonable solutions is here: [BUGS file](../master/Computator.NET/BUGS).

#####Testers
* Our **unit tests coverage is small**, partly because of the fact that there is good chunk of UI code here. Still I am affraid that there are lots and lots of not found bugs. If you want to help us fix those bugs, first try to catch them by **writing good unit tests**.

#####Users
* If **you have found ANY bugs** or you think something might be bug please report it in [**isseus**](https://github.com/PawelTroka/Computator.NET/issues) as fast as you can. Any help with testing / finding bugs is greatly appreciated.

# FAQ

###What shortcut do you use to write in exponent, just like in gif presentation?

LShift+6 (^), just like it is listed in Edit menu from where you can also activate / deactivate writing in exponent without using this shortcut.

###How can I solve equations / do my homework using this?

Computator.NET is numerical software and it aims to provide functionality similar to Matlab and Mathematica. But it certainly isn't full Computer Algebra System, at least not yet. You can solve some equations by using 'Numerical calculations tab' and 'Function root' operation. Depending on the equation different methods are working better or worse.

Alternatively you can always solve equations graphically by looking at the chart of them too.
