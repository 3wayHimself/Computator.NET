1. Binding exponent mode from edit menu to exponent mode in AvalonEdit doesnt work because AvalonEdit is in WPF and cant implement INotifyPropertyChanged
2. caret size ins't half size for wrinting in exponent in scipting (just like it is in expressions)
3. setup.gif for default installation theme doesnt seem to show in installation
4. Underflow error for MathieuMc(1,-20,2.04081632653062,-100), MathieuMc(1,-20,x,-100) caused by GSL itself
5. Folding does not work in AvalonEdit when working with documents
6. When switching to and from exponent mode in expressiontextbox and scripting a character sometimes turn to â

10. Transformations (FFT, IFFT, ...) dont work
16. Showing toolTip causes an overhead on CPU, fix by setting up a delay in showing the toolTip
17. Lack of implicit conversion from MathNet.Numerics.LinearAlgebra.Double.DenseMatrix to MathNet.Numerics.LinearAlgebra.Complex.DenseMatrix coupled with dynamic sqrt(x) causes a lot of bugs https://github.com/mathnet/mathnet-numerics/issues/304
	eg this is bug:
	var m0s = sqrt(-1)·matrix({{1,0}});//Operator '*' cannot be applied to operands of type 'System.Numerics.Complex' and 'MathNet.Numerics.LinearAlgebra.Double.DenseMatrix'
18. TSL 'FIle' class parameterless contructor creates OpenFileDialog, we need Open/Save File Dialog
20. images do not appear in installation on win xp and win vista
