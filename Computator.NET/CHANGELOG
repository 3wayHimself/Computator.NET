 * Computator.NET, 2014-2016, Paweł Troka, ptroka@fizyka.dk

 ### --------- Unreleased -----------  15.03.2016 00:53
 * = Fixed bug in binding exponent mode from edit menu to exponent mode in code editor (still doesnt work in AvalonEdit thought)
 * = Fixed bug in chart edit property window causing ComplexChart to not redraw after changes
 * = Fixed bug in ComplexChart GreaterIsLighter and GreaterIsDarker methods when NoCountourLines selected causing pitch black chart in GreaterIsLighter mode and not accurate chart in GreaterIsDarker mode

 * = Fixed minor bugs and typos in dialogs like about, features etc (for english and polish versions)
 * = Translated all previously missing elements in polish version
 * + Bug reporting now includes link to github project issues page
 * = Fixed very important bug in ScriptingExtensions - all outputs in application are now culture invariant (not being culture invariant before caused some output in non-english versions to include comma (,) instead of dot (.) for decimal separator which caused bugs when output was used in input - because we always use decimal dot (.) in TSL for decimal separation)


 ### --------- Version 2.0.0ß - beta -----------  04.03.2016 17:42
 * = TSL examples now are installed in 'my documents' folder and used from there (this resolves issues related to app not having admin right to write in program files dir)

 ### --------- Version 2.0.0α - alpha 7 -----------  20.10.2015 07:00
 * = There is no more explicit mode you have to set for everything except scripting(real, complex, 3d) - application now can deduce mode based on your expressions, if you really want you can still force mode by choosing one in status bar of app

 * + Merged with new autocomplete porting all changes, it gives new look and fixes some minor bugs
 * = Numerical calculations tab got a nice refresh of functionality and design
 * + Scripting and custom functions got something like solution explorer / directory explorer where you can create new files, edit, rename them in your working directory. You can change this directory, load a lot of files, basically it feels like having a solution exploer like this one in VisualStudio
